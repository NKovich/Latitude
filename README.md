Homework Assignment 11

For this homework we created a visualization dashboard website using data/visualizations from a previous homework assignment (API).
My specific homework file was....less than stellar, so I utilized the supplied stock images that we made available.

The website consists of seven individual pages:

1.Landing Page

  + An explanation of the project.
  
2.Vis Page 1

  + Humidity visualization with an explanation.
  
3.Vis Page 2

  + Cloudiness visualization with explanation.
  
4.Vis Page 3

  + Max Temperature visualization with explanation.
  
5.Vis Page 4

  + Wind Speed visualization with explanation.
  
6.Comparisions Page

  + All the visualizations on the same page, in a grid.
  
7.Data Page

  + A table on all the data.

We were tasked to use html, css, bootstrap and Python with Pandas.
